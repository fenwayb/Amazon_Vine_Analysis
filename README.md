<h1 align=center> Amazon Vine Analysis </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

For this project we analyzed an Amazon review dataset, specifically their  [software](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Software_v1_00.tsv.gz) one. The goal was to see if the paid Vine review program led to more 5 star reviews. 


<h2> Results </h2>
<p> The following are the results of this test</p>

***

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

  * There were 248 Vine reviews and 17514 non-Vine reviews
  
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

  * There were 102 5 star Vine reviews and 5154 non-Vine 5 star reviews
  
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

  * 41% of the Vine reviews were 5 stars while 29% of the non-Vine reviews were 5 stars

<h2> Summary </h2>
<p> There is a marked increase (over 10% more) in the percent of 5 star votes from Vine reviewers. The sample size is significantly smaller though so that could factor in. Based on this analysis there is a clear bias towards 5 star reviews from Vine reviewers, at least in the software category. <br> <br> This finding could be strengthened by repeating the practice on the other avaliable datasets as well as an aggregate of all of the datasets Amazon offers. This would help increase the sample size of Vine reviewers as well as potentially provide insight into if it is a category specific phenomenon or not. </p>
